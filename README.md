# Weather-App

I have used Weather API provided by API Ninjas to develop this Weather Application Website.

This was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

It shows various weaather parameters like temperature, humidity, cloud pct, sunrise/sunset time, wind speed and more.
User can enter any city name and the website will show the weather report of that city. By default the city is Mumbai.
