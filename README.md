# Weather-App

I have used Weather API provided by API Ninjas to develop this Weather Application Website. 

It shows various weaather parameters like temperature, humidity, cloud pct, sunrise/sunset time, wind speed and more.
User can enter any city name and the website will show the weather report of that city. By default the city is Mumbai.
