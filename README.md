# Weather-App

This was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

It shows various weather parameters like temperature, humidity, cloud pct, sunrise/sunset time, wind speed, and more. Users can enter any city name and the website will show the weather report of that city. By default the city is Mumbai.

I have used Weather API provided by API Ninjas to develop this Weather Application Website.
